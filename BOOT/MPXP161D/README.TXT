 MPXPLAY.EXE -irl -sl 0 -ddma -f0 -v -bs playlist.m3u

List of all command line options:

Playlist:
 -@  PLAYLIST : load a playlist (not really needed, Mpxplay can detect the playlist filetypes (M3U,CUE,etc.))
 -@i          : load/read playlist from stdin (m3u style)(ie: dir /b *.mp3 | mpxplay.exe -@i)
 -@s PLAYLIST.M3U  : save playlist from editor into PLAYLIST file on exit (default:MPXPLAY.M3U)
 -@sw PLAYLIST.M3U : save playlist in EXTM3U format (like Winamp)
 -@sx PLAYLIST.MXU : save playlist in (own) extended format (playlist with file infos)
 -@sc PLAYLIST.CUE : save playlist in CUE format (indexed files)
 -ds DRIVES : multiple drive scan (-ds cde -> scans c: d: e: drives)(-ds cde *.wav -> search wav files only)

 -prn  : random play
 -prn2 : randomize playlist at start
 -pre  : replay/repeat playlist
 -pre1 : replay/repeat only 1 song (rewind to the begin of file)

 -psu NUM  : startup-type (StartupEnabled) override (0,3,7,11,19,27) (see mpxplay.ini)
 -pss NUM  : start play at NUM. song  (PlayStartSong) (without NUM, it just starts the playing at the first (or last played) song)
 -pst TIME : start song at TIME pos.  (PlayStartTime) (TIME format is HOURS:MINUTES:SECONDS.HUNDREDTHS (HH:MM:SS.NN or MM:SS.NN or SSS.NN or SSS) format (ie: 3:17 or 197.25))
 -psf NUM  : start song at NUM. frame (PlayStartFrame)
 -psp NUM  : start song at NUM-16%    (PlayStartPercent)(16% is the begin of the song (116% is the end))
 -pcs NUM  : exit after NUM song      (PlayCountSong)
 -pct TIME : play duration (in 1 song)(PlayCountTime) (TIME format is like at -pst)
 -pcf NUM  : play NUM frames only     (PlayCountFrame)
 -pcp NUM  : play NUM% from the song  (PlayCountPercent) (1-100)
 -pet TIME : finish playing at TIME pos   (PlayEndTime) (TIME format is like at -pst,-pct) (-pc# options have higher priority than this)
 -pef NUM  : finish playing at NUM. frame (PlayEndFrame)(PlayFrameCount=PlayEndFrame-PlayStartFrame)(doesn't work with -psp)
 -pslf NUM : use/load NUM. fastlist (PlayStartList)(NUM. list in [fastlist] config)(without NUM, it loads the last used list and restores the list/song position from the [startup])
 -phs      : hi-lite scan, play only 10 seconds from every songs (1m00s-1m10s)(configurable with -pst,-pct,-pet options)
 -phsh     : start hi-lite scan at the half/center of the songs
 -ppa      : pause at each (all) songs
 -ppn      : pause at first (next) song (only)

Display:
 -f0  : no screen output (some warning/error messages are not displayed in this mode (ie: serial-control and LCD errors))
 -ff  : only framepos and current filename are displayed
 -fl  : one line display output
 -v   : verbose mode (mpeg info,id3tag info for -f0,-ff,-fl options)(use -fl -v order, not -v -fl)
 -fe  : full screen playlist-editor (without spectrum-analyser & browser)
 -fs  : single lines mode (disable 50 lines mode change at start)
 -db  : disable directory browser in playlist editor (left side)(use -xel option to exit after the last song) (it has higher priority than -db2)
 -db2 : use directory browser on both sides (with a single file argument it opens the dir-of-file and plays the file in dir, with playlist argument it opens the list like a sub-list (ie: mpxplay.exe -db2 d:\subdir\song.mp3))
 -ebs NUM : editor border size (1-64)(def:64)

Visual plugins (only at DOS4G version):
 -vps NAME : visual plugin selected name (else pick up all visual DLLs and skip after user-request (keyboard or mouse))
 -vpt SECS : visual plugin start time (start visualization after SECS seconds)(default: 0, visual plugins will not start without this option)

Input (file) buffer:
 -bp  : large prebuffer (32*32k=1024k) (decoder runs on INT08) (default mode)
 -bpn : -bp + preload next song before the end of current one (for better gapless playing)
 -bpm NUM : prebuffer size in megabytes (for -bp,-bs) (def: 1 (at the default -bp mode)) (1Mb = 1048576 bytes)
 -bpb NUM : prebuffer size in blocks (for -bp,-bs)(1 block=32kbytes)(use: 8 - 64 (MP3-WAV))
 -bb  : back (rewind) buffer (useful for slow drives, like cd,flash,ftp) (without -bbm option: size_of_backbuffer = size_of_prebuffer)
 -bbm NUM : use backbuffer with NUM megabytes
 -bl  : fullbuffer (it loads the (whole) file into memory before playing (depends on the free memory and the used extender too))
 -bs  : small prebuffer (4*32k=128k) (without INT08 decoding) (use this only if you have problems with the default -bp mode)
 -bni : disable interrupt decoding (for -bl)
 -bn8 : disable all INT08 functions (interrupt decoding,dma monitor)
 -bn  : no input buffer (not recommended, for testing only)
 (note for -bp/-bb: the complete size of the file (ring) buffer will be: size_of_backbuffer + size_of_prebuffer, the prebuffer-size sets that how many bytes are pre-readed from the file)

Sound card and file (wav/bitstream) output:
 -scs CARD : manual soundcard select (force) (CARD can be: in DOS version: CMI,ENS,ICH,IHD,SBA,VIA,S16,ESS,WSS,GUS,SBP,WAV,NUL, in Win version: WDS,WIN,WAV,NUL)
 -scd NUM  : select sub-device number (for WIN and WDS only) (use -sct to display device numbers (0,1,2))
 -scc NUM  : soundcard sub-config (for WDS and IHD only)
             (WDS: +1 use primary buffer, +2: loc-hardware; default=1, value 3 can give the best sound quality, but it doesn't work in every cases)
             (IHD: +1: use pc-speaker output, else headphone/lineout, +2: use fixed stream address (old v1.59 method, if the new one doesn't work))
 -sct CARD : soundcard test (without CARD argument it tests and displays all detected cards)
 -scv NUM : set sound card volume (master & pcm together)(0-100(%))(at some soundcards under Win9x use 100% (ie: SB16 emu of SB Live/Audigy))
 -ddma    : double dma (soundcard buffer) (16-bit output: 32k->64k; 24-bit: 48k->96k; 32-bit: 64k->128k) (recommended to use if outfreq>48000)
 -o       : write pcm data to a wav file (instead of soundcard)(rather use this than -scs WAV)
 -of  NUM : set output frequency (constant soundcard freq or freq conversion at wav output)
 -oc  NUM : set output channels (WDS: 2-8, wav-file: 1-8)
 -ob  NUM : set output bits (Audigy 2/4,Live24,ICH4,IHD,WIN,WDS,wav-file)
 -obf     : write 32-bit floating-point pcm data (id=0x0003) (WDS and wav-file)
 -obs     : bitstream mode output (no decoding)(currently for file-out (-o) and with AAC,AC3,DTS,MP2,MP3 (AVI,ASF,MKV,MP4,MPG,TS) input/output only)(ie: mpxplay.exe -o -obs infile.mp3 outfile.mp3 -pst 1:00 -pct 0:30)
 -oni     : create output filename from the id3-info (at -o,-obs)(nn. artist - title.wav)(works only if LFN is supported (with DOSLFN or under Windows))
 -oat     : automatically copy tags from input to output file (at encoders: FLAC,LAME,OGGV)
 -t       : testmode (no sound output, only decoding)
 Separated soundcard mixer channel settings (most of the cards have master and pcm mixchan only):
  -scvom NUM : output master volume (0-100)
  -scvop NUM : output pcm volume
  -scvoh NUM : output headphone volume
  -scvos NUM : output spdif volume
  -scvim NUM : input mic volume
  -scvil NUM : input line volume
  -scvic NUM : input cd volume
  -scvia NUM : input aux volume

Sound mixing and output modifying:
 -sv   NUM : software volume setting (amplifying)(0-700)(def.: 100 (%))(volume is increased manually, decreased by limiter (latter has no desktop effect))
 -sva      : enable auto volume correction (slow)
 -sr   NUM : surround/stereo expander (def.:100 (%) = no surround, 10=mono, 150=wide stereo)
 -sp   NUM : playing speed (freq) control (50-990)(def.: 100) (or 500-9999 (def. 1000) if you set MixerControl=5)
 -sctr NUM : set tone-treble (1-100) (SB16,AWE32/64: hardware; otherwise (or with MixerControl=3): software)
 -scbs NUM : set tone-bass   (1-100) (def.: 50 = no tone change)
 -sl   NUM : soundlimit (playlimit)(0-200)(def.:20)(finishes the playing of the song if the sound volume is under the limit)
 -mxlo NUM : volume limiter overflow value in dB (0-18) (def.:0) (you can get a little more sound volume with distortion)
 -mxmd NUM : mute volume divisor (1-999) (def: 8)

 -csa NUM : select audio stream (in ASF,AVI,MKV,MP4,MPG,OGG,TS containers, if it contains more than one audio stream) (0 means the first/primary stream)

 -cl : decode left channel only (1.9x/1.4x faster decoding at MP3/OGG files (only))
 -cm : downmix channels (stereo to mono)(ca. 1.7x faster decoding at MP3 files only)

 -cf      : enable crossfade
 -cft NUM : crossfadetype   (def. 1) (0.bit (+1) :fade-out, 1.bit (+2) :fade-in)(-cft 3 : fade out + fade-in)

 -cfp NUM : crossfade point (def. 120)(start crossfade at num. frame, relative to begining of fade-out)
 -cfi NUM : fade-in length  (def. 200)
 -cfl NUM : crossfade limit (def. 0) (start crossfade, when volume less than num (don't use crossfade point))
 (crossfade only: -cfo 150 -cfp 0 -cfi 150 , fade-out & fade-in only: -cfo 150 -cfp 150 -cfi 100 )

ID3-info, file-info loading:
 -inl : don't preload (load at skip only) file informations (header,id3tag) (but MXU/EXTM3U works (has effect))
 -irl : load infos at program start (start playing only if all fileinfos are loaded)
 -ipl : load (all) infos paralell with playing
 -idl : load infos of displayed files only (displayed in playlist editor window)
 -ihl : load infos of highlighted file only (at cursor move (up/down arrows))
 -in  : don't load/display id3tag infos (only filename and time-length)
 -inf : don't load id3tag infos from files (but use LFN and EXTM3U/MXU/CUE infos) (equal to LoadID3Tag=5 in mpxplay.ini)
 -if KEYWORD : tag-filter (keep files which have KEYWORD in their id3tag(s) (or in filename(s) if there's no id3tag), delete the others)(restrictions: works properly with -irl option only; KEYWORD may not contain space(s); very slow at large playlists)

ID3-tag write/update in audio files (at aac,ac3,ape,asf,dts,flac,mp2,mp3,mp4,mpc,ogg,wv files) (APETag,ID3v1,ID3v2,ASF,Flac,MP4,Ogg):
 -iw  : enable id3-tag writing
 -ita "artist"  : set artist tag (these options work without -iw option too)
 -itt "title"   : set title tag  (you also can use a listfile (-il) to set artist:title infos)
 -itl "album"   : set album tag
 -ity "year"    : set year tag
 -itc "comment" : set comment tag
 -itg "genre"   : set genre tag  (note: ID3v1 has standard (static) genre-types only (see id3genres[] in in_mp3.c))
 -itn "tracknum": set tracknum tag (note: ID3v1.1 (MP2,MP3) can store a number between 0 and 255 (ie: -itn "63") only)
 (note: if the audio file already has id3-tag and you don't set new tag(s)
        then the program keeps the original tags of the file
        you can use "" to clear a tag (ie: -itl ""))

Character (codepage) conversion (from audio files to Mpxplay and back):
 DOS only:
 -8   : convert characters in id3tags (configured by WinChars/DosChars in mpxplay.ini) (options priority: -8w < -8ucp/-8ccp < -8)
 -8f  : convert characters in filenames too (not recomended) (use it with -8)(-8u has no effect on filenames, -8ua converts filenames in M3U8,FPL and on display)(if a char conversion is wrong, remove it from the WinChars/DosChars)
 -8u  : enable UTF-8 text decoding in tags (in every tags/filetypes) (not recomended)
 -8ua : enable auto UTF-8 and UTF-16 decoding (where it's required)(APEv2,ASF,FLAC,ID3v2,Ogg,FPL,M3U8)(enabled by default, you can disable it in mpxplay.ini (Conv852437))
 -8uv : validate (use only) WinChars at UTF-8 decoding (above ascii 128)(to avoid wrong/false decoding at non-utf8 texts)
 -8b  : convert back chars (for -iw)(from Mpxplay to audio files, from DOSchars to WINchars only)(because -8 converts in both direction)
 -8ucp CPNAME : source codepage (for UTF decoding and for codepage conversion) (default: ISO-8859-2) (see moreinfo.txt for more CPNAMEs)
 -8ccp CPNAME : target codepage for codepage conversion (def: CP437)
 (For convertable codepages like CP1250/CP852 you can use the -8ucp/-8ccp options, but for the non-convertable ones like CP1250/CP437 you have to use the manual configuration of WinChars/DosChars with the -8 option)

 WIN: basically the single-char to unicode (and back) conversions depend on the locale setting of your Windows (LOCALE_USER)
 -8ucp option is still exist, but it's needed only if the source texts/id3tags are in different codepage than your Windows
 -8ccp option is only to set the codepage of the fullscreen console desktop (the default/initial setting is CP437) (in windowed mode all (most) unicode chars are displayed correctly)
  (the desktop of Mpxplay has built in CP437, some drawing chars are missing in other codepages)

Playlist sort (read moreinfo.txt, sort bugs too):
 -io  NUM : primary order key; order playlist by 0=title, 1=artist, 2=album, 3=year, 4=comment (file-extension in commander mode), 5=genre, 6=tracknum, 7=time, 8=filesize, 9=path, 10=filename, 11=path\filename, 12=filedate, 99=disable ordering (order only directory entires by filename)
 -io2 NUM : secondary order key (0=title, 1=artist, etc.)
 -io3 NUM : third order key (-"-)
 -io4 NUM : fourth order key (-"-)
 -iod     : descending order (else ascending)(use it with -io)

ID3-list:
 -il [infofile] : load LOCAL id3info listfile (for directory browser (left side), (re)loads list from every directory (after dir change)) (see moreinfo.txt too)
 -ig [infofile] : load GLOBAL id3info listfile (for both sides (directory browser and playlist)(create of id3list: mpxplay.exe playlist.m3u -@sx infofile.txt)
 -is [infofile] : save id3 infos in a listfile
 -ist NUM : field-types for -is (the bits of the NUM change/enable the fields)(def.:61)
   0. bit (  +1): list directory names
   1. bit (  +2): list filenames
   2. bit (  +4): artist-title list mode (non-fixed/fixed position)
   3. bit (  +8): list time of file
   4. bit ( +16): list bitrate (kbit/s)
   5. bit ( +32): list filesize in megabytes
   6. bit ( +64): list filenames with full path

 -xs        : call a dosshell (automatically) after the start of Mpxplay
 -xr        : DOS version: TSR mode (works properly at CDW files only)('mpxplay.exe -bl -xr -xs -pre1 song.mp3' for continuous background playing)(this option has keeped for a possible future developing, it's not really usefull)
              Win32 version: +1 thread for file prebuffering (disk reading doesn't stop the control/display functions and vica versa)
 -xas       : enable atx/apm power (hardware) shutdown (at exit)
 -xce       : confirm exit
 -xel       : exit at end of (play)list (has effect in directory browser and in jukebox queue too)

 -xtl TIME  : program run-time length (from -xts or from the start of the program)(max. 24 hours)(TIME may be in HH:MM:SS or HH:MM or HH format)
              (note: HH is hour(s), MM is minute(s), SS is second(s))
 -dlls      : list informations about DLLs in Mpxplay's dir (at DOS4G and WIN versions)
